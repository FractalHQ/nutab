A minimal yet versatile new-tab browser extension.

- Scroll up to browse the HN Reader
- Add your bookmarks and organize them with folders and tags.
- Up and Down arrow keys change search engines when the search bar is focused (or type 'hn', 'ddg', 'so', etc as shortcuts before your query')

The extension is still under development, so it's not published yet.

In the meantime, you can use it as a web page:  https://nutab.vercel.app

To test the extension, load the "build" folder as an "unpacked" extension.
